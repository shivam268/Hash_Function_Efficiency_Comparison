  This is file prog1.README in the directory 

          ~csi402/public/prog1

You should also take a careful look at the following 
additional files in this directory. 

  (1) submission_info.txt: This file explains how you should use
      the turnin-csi402 program to submit your source files
      and makefile. It also contains additional specifications
      for your makefile.

  (2) hash_one.c and hash_two.c  -- The C source files for the
      two hash functions needed for this assignment. 

  (3) input.txt and output.txt -- A sample input file and the
      corresponding output file. (See below.)

Information about the sample input: 
-----------------------------------

  File input.txt in this directory is a sample input file for this
program. (As mentioned in the handout, the first line of this file
contains the hash table size. Each subsequent line is a symbol that 
must be inserted into the hash table.)

   When we run the executable version of your program (p1) on
the file input.txt  using the Unix command

          p1  input.txt  out.txt

the contents of the file out.txt produced by your program
should agree with the contents of the file output.txt in this
directory.  

Note: You should NOT hardcode the above file names into your
      program. Instead, you should rely on command line arguments
      to get the names of input and output files.
