# ICSI402_p1
Hash Function Efficiency Comparison


This is a small C program written for CSI402 at Ualbany. It uses two hash functions provided and outputs information about the efficiency of them. The hash tables resolve collision by using chaining. The following information is examined:
1) The size of the hash table
2) The number of non empty buckets
3) The maximum number of entries within the buckets
4) The minumum number of entries within the non empty buckets
5) The average number of entries within the buckets

An example input file and output file has been provided courtesy of Proffesor Ravi. Both hash functions are also provided courtesy of proffesor Ravi.
